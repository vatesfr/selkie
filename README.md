Selkie
=======================

Introduction
------------
__To write__.

Installation
------------

Using Composer (recommended)
----------------------------
The recommended way to get a working copy of this project is to clone the repository
and use `composer` to install dependencies using the `install` command:

    cd selkie/dir
	./composer self-update
    ./composer install

(The `self-update` directive is to ensure you have an up-to-date `composer`
available.)

Virtual Host
------------
Afterwards, set up a virtual host to point to the public/ directory of the
project and you should be ready to go!
